I started by adding the rest of the fingers (thumb,pointer,middle,ring,pinky) and positioning them on the cube and next to eachother and before that i added a cube for the hand 
and for the wrist motion to be more realistic after that i started scaling as for example the pinky finger is a little smaller than the rest of the fingers and so on moving on
with the rotation i struggled a bit with it and i searched the range of motion of every part (shoulder,elbow,wrist,fingers.) as well as trying with my own arm to make the motion
realistic as possible for example we can rotate our shoulder for 360 degrees but we can't do that with our elbow or wrist the same with fingers i had to add different alternatives
like moving all fingers at the same time or moving every one individually as well as the fingers' joints
